## Setup — Before Going Live

### 1. Add CV

Place your CV PDF in the project root:

```
Wilson_Karanja_CV.pdf
```

The download button in `contact.html` and `skills.html` is already wired to this filename.

### 2. Activate the Contact Form (Formspree)

1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and create a free account
2. Create a new form — set the email to `wmkaranja996@gmail.com`
3. Copy the form ID (e.g. `xpzgkqab`)
4. Open `contact.html` and replace `YOUR_FORM_ID`:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">

<!-- After -->
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/xpzgkqab" method="POST">
```

5. In your Formspree dashboard, add your domain to the **allowed domains** list for security.

### 3. Add LinkedIn and GitHub Links

In `contact.html`, replace the `#` placeholders:

```html
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR-PROFILE" ...>LinkedIn ↗</a>
<a href="https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME" ...>GitHub ↗</a>
```

### 4. Deploy

Push to any static host:

```bash
# Netlify (drag and drop the folder at netlify.com/drop)

# GitHub Pages
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial build — Manjahi Dev's v1.0"
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/manjahi-devs.git
git push -u origin main
# Then enable GitHub Pages in repo Settings → Pages

# Vercel
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### 5. Connect a Custom Domain

Once hosted, point your domain (e.g. `manjahidevs.com`) to the host via your domain registrar's DNS settings. Most hosts (Netlify, Vercel) provide step-by-step instructions in their dashboard.
